# PyTree

<div align="center">
  
**A Modern Educational Tool for Visualizing Binary Search Trees**

*Developed by Justin Paul Guida | Southern New Hampshire University*

</div>

## Overview

**PyTree** is an interactive visualization tool that helps students and developers understand Binary Search Tree (BST) operations through visual learning. Built with PyQt6, it provides a clean, professional interface for exploring tree algorithms in real-time.

> **Note:** This is a personal learning project created for educational purposes and portfolio demonstration. While the code is publicly available for reference and learning, this repository is maintained as a solo project and is not accepting external contributions.

## üåü Why I Built This

I developed PyTree to help myself and others truly **see the patterns** in binary trees. There's something powerful about watching algorithms unfold visually that reading code alone can't provide. When you can see how a search traverses left and right, how insertions find their perfect spot, and how the tree's structure emerges organically, the abstract concepts become concrete and intuitive.

Binary trees aren't just data structures - they're beautiful patterns of organization that mirror how we naturally categorize and search through information. This visualizer exists because sometimes the best way to understand something is to watch it happen, step by step, until the patterns become second nature.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jguida941/Pytree
cd Pytree

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python simple_binary_tree_ex.py
```

### macOS Terminal Fix

If you get a Qt platform plugin error on macOS:
```
qt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin "cocoa"
```

**Quick Fix (run before your app):**
```bash
export QT_PLUGIN_PATH=$(python -c "import PyQt6.QtCore; import os; print(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(PyQt6.QtCore.__file__), 'plugins'))")
python simple_binary_tree_ex.py
```

**Permanent Fix (add to ~/.zshrc):**
```bash
echo 'export QT_PLUGIN_PATH=$(python -c "import PyQt6.QtCore as qc; import os; print(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(qc.__file__), \"plugins\"))")' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## üíª Usage Examples

### Building a Tree Programmatically
```python
from simple_binary_tree_ex import BinarySearchTree

# Create a new BST
bst = BinarySearchTree()

# Insert values
values = [50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80]
for value in values:
    bst.insert(value)

# Perform operations
result = bst.inorder_traversal()
print("In-order traversal:", result)

found = bst.search(60)
print("Search for 60:", "Found" if found else "Not found")
```

### Interactive GUI Features
1. **Insert Operations** - Enter values and watch the tree grow organically
2. **Search Operations** - Find values with visual path highlighting  
3. **Delete Operations** - Remove nodes and see automatic tree restructuring
4. **Real-time Traversal** - In-order sequence updates instantly with each operation
5. **Clear Tree** - Reset to start fresh with new tree structures

## üß† The Power of Visual Learning

### Pattern Recognition
- **Tree Shape Patterns** - See how different insertion orders create different tree structures
- **Search Patterns** - Watch how the binary search property guides every search decision
- **Balance Patterns** - Visualize when trees become unbalanced and why it matters

### Algorithmic Intuition
- **Recursive Thinking** - See how tree operations naturally break down into smaller subproblems
- **Comparison Logic** - Watch the simple "less than/greater than" decisions that drive everything
- **Path Visualization** - Understand that every tree operation is really about finding the right path
